## Background

0xDAO describes itself as a [liquidity provider hub](https://medium.com/@0xdao/0xdao-a-liquidity-hub-for-solidly-made-with-love-by-fantom-builders-265b86130ec1) for Solidly on the Fantom network.

## Involvement

The oxCouncil was originally founded to assist 0xDAO token holders with aggregating vlOXD votes.
We continue to provide action-oriented messaging for the 0xDAO team to reach retail institutional
token holders.


### OXD PO6

The oxCouncil pitched a [proposition to the 0xDAO team](https://twitter.com/oxcouncil/status/1521561217122414593) regarding upping the rewards for native liquidity tokens on the 0xDAO protocol.

The 0xDAO team accepted our proposition and [put the motion towards a governance vote.](https://snapshot.org/#/oxdaofi.eth/proposal/0x754c20fe5e717a469b3b5b824784c996d230f4c3ff19d09c4e7a7c1fc2486ffa)

OXD holders voted unanimously to [pass the proposition](https://twitter.com/oxcouncil/status/1525158413906370560)
